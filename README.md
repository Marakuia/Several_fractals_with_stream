# Several_fractals_with_stream
fractals with streams

In this work, an application is implemented that generates three types of fractals: Mandelbrot, Tricorn, Burning Ship. Threads were also implemented for faster calculation when approaching a point <br/>
At the top of the application there is a drop-down list that allows you to select the desired fractal. <br/>
By default, the application opens on the Mandelbrot fractal. <br/>
When you click on any point of the fractal, you move closer to that point. <br/>
The figure below shows the Mandelbrot fractal and the zoom to the selected point. <br/>

The figure below shows the Tricorn fractal and its zoom to the selected point. <br/>

There is also a Reset button, which resets the zoom and returns the fractal to its original form, and a Save button, which saves the image in png format.
